## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I always skip css variables when I was still learning CSS but now I understand the importance and when to use them on a project. So i dived more into css variables and also learnt how to give users full control of various themes to choose from. It was fun working on this project but I faced alot of difficulties with making the calculator function well
